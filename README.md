# assembly-tanks-game
Created this small cool game at the age of 16 in assembly x86. 
Unfortunately not the cleanest code and all in one file, but hey! At least a lot of comments :)

## Run the game
- I used DOSbox for running the game
- if you dont want to build it all:
  - Open DOSbox 
  - Type command: "mount [PATH_TO_REPO]"
  - Now just "PROJECT.EXE"
